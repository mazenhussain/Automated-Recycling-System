# Automated-Recycling-System

Simulated in the Quanser environment. This system sorts recycleable items and delivers them to the proper waste container. The system uses a robot arm to place similar containers into the Q-Bot which then uses a line following algorithm and colour sensors to deliver the containers to the correct bins. The Q-Bot deposits the recyclables and returns back to the arm.
